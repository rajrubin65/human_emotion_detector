# human_emotion_detector
# #IMAGE CLASSIFICATION MODEL
    # A sample model to identify the human emotions
    # It is  a deeplearning Model
    # The models are created using the Tensorflow librarie.

# To Run the code :
    # step1:
        set the enviornment
            cmd: python -m virtualenv venv
        Activate the enviornment
            cmd: venv/scripts/activate
        Install all the dependencies
            cmd: pip install -r requirements
        To run the pipeline
            cmd: python live_detection.py

Note: The dataset is less and also it is not that much good, we can fine tune it.
Accuracy: get acurracy around 75
